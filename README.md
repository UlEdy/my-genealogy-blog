# Genealogy Web Application - A blog with features that will help me showcase my family history 

This is a genealogy web application project that includes blog features to help me present the history of my family. The application will allow me to gather, store, and share information about my family tree. With the blog features, I will be able to publish articles, stories, and anecdotes related to my ancestors.

The key features of the application include:

- Creating and managing a family tree.
- Adding family members, their biographical information, photos, etc.
- Creating blog posts related to different individuals or events in my family.
- Browsing and sharing blog posts with other users.
- The ability to comment and interact with other individuals interested in genealogy.
 
I hope that this application will help me gain a better understanding of my family's history and connect with others who share similar genealogical interests.
